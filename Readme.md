## Description

I tried to finish this quiz however never manged to find time to finish this quiz, However i managed to get the timer and questioneds to display. That alone took me a while to figure out how to do but with some help from my tutor a while ago that was easier to display then figureing out how to display the question. Did mange to get some css styling in there as that is much easier.
